1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:04,812
From the top, one more time, guys.

2
00:00:04,932 --> 00:00:06,919
Everyone, I need your attention.
Gather up.

3
00:00:07,192 --> 00:00:09,516
I said everyone, Sketch-Tron 6000.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,189
Mr. Hank Hooper,

5
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:16,155
the owner of our new
parent company, Kabletown,

6
00:00:16,165 --> 00:00:18,635
is touring 30 Rock
for the first time today.

7
00:00:18,703 --> 00:00:20,937
I <i>will</i> make
a good first impression,

8
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:24,130
so I need all of you
to be your most normal.

9
00:00:24,197 --> 00:00:27,132
Tracy, do not mention where
you think dinosaurs come from.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,567
Do not mention
the underwater city

11
00:00:28,634 --> 00:00:30,002
of Sauronicon...
Got it.

12
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:31,470
Jenna, get all of your
crazy yelling

13
00:00:31,537 --> 00:00:32,554
out of your system.

14
00:00:32,638 --> 00:00:33,772
If you don't volumize my hair,

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,340
I will choke you to death

16
00:00:35,408 --> 00:00:37,642
- with your boyfriend's wig!
- Very good.

17
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,544
Frank, how is
your armpit thing?

18
00:00:39,612 --> 00:00:41,813
Not great. It's almost
touching my thigh thing.

19
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:46,585
Okay, let's do our best.

20
00:00:46,652 --> 00:00:50,222
Remember, everyone,
just don't be yourselves.

21
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:53,041
Lemon, meet me
in my office in ten.

22
00:00:53,126 --> 00:00:54,326
I need to ask you something.

23
00:00:54,377 --> 00:00:56,661
Oh, do you need sex advice?
Here's a tip.

24
00:00:56,729 --> 00:00:59,097
Sometimes a lady likes
to leave her blazer on.

25
00:01:01,534 --> 00:01:04,720
Sir, ma'am,
this is for you... a gift bag.

26
00:01:04,804 --> 00:01:07,072
"To my two favorite
sketch stars.

27
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,558
Your new friend,
Hank Hooper."

28
00:01:09,642 --> 00:01:12,477
That's nice.
Actors deserve gifts.

29
00:01:12,545 --> 00:01:14,980
Without us, who would
present awards to actors?

30
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:21,520
So...Which one of us is
going to get this computer?

31
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:24,055
Just kidding.
We both are!

32
00:01:24,107 --> 00:01:25,690
Wow, I always wanted
one of these.

33
00:01:25,758 --> 00:01:27,359
The box would make
a perfect coffin

34
00:01:27,427 --> 00:01:28,410
for my Teddy Bear.

35
00:01:28,494 --> 00:01:31,229
There's two of everything!

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,800
Look at us.
When we met four years ago,

37
00:01:34,867 --> 00:01:36,868
we were fighting about
the silliest things...

38
00:01:36,936 --> 00:01:38,703
Dressing rooms, air time,

39
00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:40,539
you coming in
and ruining my show...

40
00:01:40,606 --> 00:01:42,374
You taking
my nephew's virginity.

41
00:01:42,442 --> 00:01:45,744
I feel we've finally found
a balance in our relationship.

42
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:53,952
There's only one.

43
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,155
You take it.
I don't care.

44
00:01:57,223 --> 00:01:59,925
I want you to selfishly take
the best sweatshirt

45
00:01:59,992 --> 00:02:02,494
in the world.

46
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,898
Lemon, this is
a little delicate,

47
00:02:06,949 --> 00:02:10,001
but I wonder if you
might take Avery shopping

48
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:11,203
for baby things.

49
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,438
- Oh, sure.
- You know, a crib,

50
00:02:13,506 --> 00:02:15,407
small clothes, a tiny desk

51
00:02:15,475 --> 00:02:17,542
with a miniature pen set on it.

52
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,077
I don't know a lot
about babies,

53
00:02:19,145 --> 00:02:20,579
but I know that
Avery would enjoy

54
00:02:20,646 --> 00:02:22,914
having another woman
go with her.

55
00:02:22,982 --> 00:02:24,249
Of course.
I'm just a little surprised.

56
00:02:24,317 --> 00:02:26,918
I assumed Avery would have
a terrifying best friend

57
00:02:26,986 --> 00:02:28,553
she'd do stuff like that with.

58
00:02:28,621 --> 00:02:29,921
Avery does have a sister,

59
00:02:29,972 --> 00:02:32,324
but Eugenia is currently
institutionalized for nerves...

60
00:02:32,391 --> 00:02:33,458
[whispers] Lesbian...

61
00:02:33,526 --> 00:02:34,759
And all of her work friends
are out

62
00:02:34,827 --> 00:02:36,061
because she's still trying

63
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:37,562
to keep her pregnancy a secret.

64
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,164
Really?
She's eight months.

65
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,982
How is she possibly hiding it?

66
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:42,067
Michael Kors is a friend.

67
00:02:42,134 --> 00:02:43,485
We own a gay racehorse
together.

68
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:45,871
And I convinced him to make
wizard cloaks fashionable

69
00:02:45,938 --> 00:02:47,072
for ladies this winter.

70
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:48,306
It's my fault for asking.

71
00:02:48,374 --> 00:02:50,775
The problem is that
Avery is very close

72
00:02:50,843 --> 00:02:52,444
to being named
the financial reporter

73
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:53,612
for <i>NBC Nightly News.</i>

74
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:54,979
If anyone finds out
she's pregnant,

75
00:02:55,031 --> 00:02:56,114
she won't get the job.

76
00:02:56,165 --> 00:02:58,283
Ah, see,
that would never happen

77
00:02:58,334 --> 00:02:59,951
if <i>men</i> could get pregnant.

78
00:03:00,002 --> 00:03:01,986

of my one-act play

<i>The Seahorses</i>
<i>of Warwickshire Abbey.</i>

80
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:06,374
Avery just needs to keep
her condition under wraps

81
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:08,426
until her contract is signed.

82
00:03:08,494 --> 00:03:09,794
Unfortunately,
her competition for the job

83
00:03:09,862 --> 00:03:13,164
is Carmen Chao...
From MSNBC.

84
00:03:13,216 --> 00:03:15,867
Oh, I know her.
Hey, what ethnicity is she?

85
00:03:15,935 --> 00:03:17,035
No one knows.

86

to meet with premier

90
00:03:23,476 --> 00:03:25,577
and then stopping
for a well-deserved vacation

91
00:03:25,645 --> 00:03:27,011
in Negril, Jamaica, mon.

92
00:03:27,063 --> 00:03:29,281
If Carmen finds out
Avery's pregnant,

93
00:03:29,348 --> 00:03:31,550
she'll use it to destroy her.
Carmen's very sneaky.

94
00:03:31,617 --> 00:03:33,518
And that's not racist because
I don't know what she is.

95
00:03:33,586 --> 00:03:35,520
Man, we all lead
such complicated lives.

96
00:03:35,588 --> 00:03:36,655
Hey, do you want to go

to that new popcorn place

98
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:39,374
I'm going

I can't wait to shake his hand.

101
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:45,130
You can tell a lot about someone
by their handshake.

102
00:03:45,198 --> 00:03:47,766
You are confident.

103
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:51,336
And you ate dinner

No. Doesn't count
as a hug

00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:25,654

for ten seconds.

Do you know who came up

It was the guy who
drives me home every night.

141

The original name for the DVR

142

was "The Thing
Carlos Thought Of."

No. You can't take this
away from me,

196

Was I supposed to throw up
in something of mine?

199

You gave this to me.

200

And I can take it back.
I'm the star here.

- Are you pregnant?
- Isn't that wonderful news?

225

for Avery last night.

So what, now people think
I'm pregnant?

Do I have to do
this mom news story?

I am telling everyone here

that there's no way
I could be pregnant

00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:43,087
Well, <i>employee</i> pitch day was,

321
00:11:43,154 --> 00:11:44,722
of course,
a new experience for me.

322
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:46,390
Oh, speaking of
new experiences,

323
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,892
I ate at an Indian restaurant
last night.

324
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,160
I had naan.

325
00:11:50,228 --> 00:11:52,646
Sir... I mean, Hank,

326
00:11:52,731 --> 00:11:54,064
I appreciate that you have
your way of doing things,

327
00:11:54,132 --> 00:11:55,265
but so do I.

328
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,002
I am a Six Sigma
Black Belt Ultra,

329
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:59,770
with the groin branding
to prove it.

330
00:11:59,838 --> 00:12:01,405
What's Six Sigma?
Rock band?

331
00:12:01,473 --> 00:12:02,606
I'd like to start this meeting

332
00:12:02,674 --> 00:12:05,275
by sharing one of my own ideas.

333
00:12:05,343 --> 00:12:07,144
And after you hear it,
maybe we can agree

334
00:12:07,212 --> 00:12:09,613
that employee pitch day
is time that could be

335
00:12:09,681 --> 00:12:12,282
better spent drinking and
looking out the window.

336
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,584
Okay, Jack!

337
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:15,502
You're putting it on the line.

338
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:17,021
What have you got?

339
00:12:17,088 --> 00:12:19,223
Hank, what's the one part
of the television experience

340
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,424
that's not perfect?

341
00:12:20,492 --> 00:12:22,593
To me, it's the remote control.

342
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,694
Too easy to lose, right?

343
00:12:23,762 --> 00:12:26,363
Yes! I lose my remote
all the time.

344
00:12:26,431 --> 00:12:29,133
Grr, couch cushions!
[Chuckles]

345
00:12:29,184 --> 00:12:30,834
What if you didn't need
a remote control

346
00:12:30,902 --> 00:12:33,670
because your remote control
was your own voice?

347
00:12:33,738 --> 00:12:37,775
Television on.
Channel, NBC.

348
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:40,177
A crew out of the Bronx
called the Ace of Deuces.

349
00:12:40,245 --> 00:12:41,512
Amazing.

350
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:44,448
I give you voice activation.

351
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:46,950
Word from my C.I.
is he got offed by...

352
00:12:47,018 --> 00:12:48,886
That shouldn't happen.
TV on!

353
00:12:48,953 --> 00:12:52,022
Voice activation,
or "Vo-act..."

354
00:12:52,073 --> 00:12:54,324
The only wit we have
is some mute kid...

355
00:12:54,392 --> 00:12:56,894
- Un-mute!
- My friends at the D.E.A. say

356
00:12:56,961 --> 00:12:59,630
these guys have
a high volume of cocaine...

357
00:12:59,697 --> 00:13:01,165
Low volume.
Low volume!

358
00:13:01,216 --> 00:13:03,250
First I want to go home
and delete everything

359
00:13:03,334 --> 00:13:05,369
- that's on my DVR.
- Oh, come on!

360
00:13:05,437 --> 00:13:07,037
TV mute!

361
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:10,040
Jack, it doesn't seem to work.

362
00:13:10,108 --> 00:13:11,475
You got any other notions,

363
00:13:11,543 --> 00:13:13,210
or should we jump
to employee ideas?

364
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:15,913
No, no. No.
I have another idea.

365
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,417
What if, uh...
What if...

366
00:13:20,485 --> 00:13:23,287
You had a black bar
at the bottom of the screen

367
00:13:23,354 --> 00:13:25,355
that prevented you from
seeing anything dirty?

368
00:13:25,423 --> 00:13:27,191
I like that.

369
00:13:27,242 --> 00:13:28,525
I like that a lot.

370
00:13:28,593 --> 00:13:30,994
It would allow parents
to eliminate racy content,

371
00:13:31,062 --> 00:13:33,396
like soccer, or a woman
stuffing a turkey.

372
00:13:33,448 --> 00:13:36,166
That's a real family company
kind of idea, Jack.

373
00:13:36,234 --> 00:13:38,419
And we could sell ads
in the black bar...

374
00:13:38,503 --> 00:13:39,770
Increase our revenue streams!

375
00:13:39,838 --> 00:13:41,738
You could call it
"Blabar."

376
00:13:41,806 --> 00:13:43,674
A-plus work, Jack!

377
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:45,442
I don't need to hear
anything else.

378
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,945
If that's the kind of ideas
you're bringing... nine, ten...

379
00:13:48,012 --> 00:13:53,016
You will go far, son.
Yeah!

380
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,421
Crap.

381
00:13:58,473 --> 00:14:01,024
Kenneth, we need to talk.

382
00:14:01,092 --> 00:14:03,460
Earlier today,
I told Hank Hooper

383
00:14:03,528 --> 00:14:07,097
about your black bar concept,
and he loved it.

384
00:14:07,165 --> 00:14:09,900
However, I presented it
as my own idea.

385
00:14:09,968 --> 00:14:11,902
Wonderful! Next topic.

386
00:14:11,953 --> 00:14:13,804
What? Uh, no.

387
00:14:13,872 --> 00:14:15,906
This is an opportunity for you.

388
00:14:15,974 --> 00:14:18,575
You have me over a barrel.
What are you going to do?

389
00:14:18,643 --> 00:14:20,110
Not what my uncle does

390
00:14:20,178 --> 00:14:22,045
when he gets a hitchhiker over
a barrel, I'll tell you that.

391
00:14:22,113 --> 00:14:23,914
This is business, Kenneth.

392
00:14:23,982 --> 00:14:25,949
All bosses steal
from their employees.

393
00:14:26,017 --> 00:14:28,752
But in return,
the employee gets something.

394
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,188
You didn't steal anything
from me, sir.

395
00:14:31,256 --> 00:14:32,289
Last time I checked,

396
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,058
best friends can't steal
from each other.

397
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:37,828
Now, stop being a silly Simon.

398
00:14:37,896 --> 00:14:39,763
[Chuckles]

399
00:14:39,814 --> 00:14:42,666
This isn't how it works!

400
00:14:42,734 --> 00:14:45,602
You're the one being
a silly Simon!

401
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,840
Carmen, what are you
doing here?

402
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:51,825
Well, you didn't call back
to schedule our interview,

403
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,026
so I thought I'd just
ambush you

404
00:14:53,111 --> 00:14:54,278
with some pregnancy questions.

405
00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:55,829
I hope you're not unprepared.

406
00:14:55,914 --> 00:14:58,282
Of course not.

407
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,851
- When are you due?
- April 20th, Hitler's birthday.

408
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,186
What's your pediatrician's
name?

409
00:15:02,253 --> 00:15:04,288
Dr. Rufus T. Barleysheath.

410
00:15:04,355 --> 00:15:06,006
- Where was the baby conceived?
- In my vagina.

411
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,257
What names are you considering?

412
00:15:07,325 --> 00:15:09,126
- Rufus T. Barleysheath.
- How are you feeling?

413
00:15:09,177 --> 00:15:10,460
Oh, a little achy and nauseous,

414
00:15:10,512 --> 00:15:11,562
- but I'm hanging in there.
- Are you pregnant?

415
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:15,632
No...way that I'm not.

416
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,100
Owen, screw.

417
00:15:19,237 --> 00:15:20,971
I don't know why
you're doing this for Jessup.

418
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,673
She's a blonde. Don't you know
there's a war going on?

419
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,275
Or are you doing it
for her old man husband?

420
00:15:25,343 --> 00:15:26,443
He's your boss.

421
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:28,779
First of all,
Jack means nothing to me.

422
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:30,547
Shoot him in the throat
and let the dogs eat him.

423
00:15:30,615 --> 00:15:31,532
I don't care.

424
00:15:31,616 --> 00:15:32,749
What's wrong with you?

425
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:34,051
Almost everything.

426
00:15:34,118 --> 00:15:35,185
But let's get back
to the interview.

427
00:15:35,236 --> 00:15:36,753
We're done with that portion.

428
00:15:36,821 --> 00:15:38,488
I thought it would be
a fun visual

429
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,191
if we got some b-roll of you
taking sexy pregnancy photos

430
00:15:41,242 --> 00:15:42,492
where you bare your stomach

431
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,661
like the pregnant bitch
that you are.

432
00:15:44,729 --> 00:15:45,896
What do you say?

433
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,801
Let's take some pictures.

434
00:15:55,185 --> 00:15:58,787
Innovation that is both family
and bottom line friendly.

435
00:15:58,855 --> 00:16:02,958
Gentlemen, I give you Blabar.

436
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:04,894
You're really sexing me
right now.

437
00:16:04,961 --> 00:16:06,862
It's filthy.

438
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,498
[Laughter, applause]

439
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:10,866
Jack! Jack!

440
00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:14,103
All: Jack! Jack! Jack...

[Whistles]

442
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:18,507
[Elevator bell dings]

443
00:16:29,486 --> 00:16:30,753
One time, I saw a turtle...

444
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,023
Who the hell
do you think you are?

445
00:16:35,075 --> 00:16:37,059
This is not the way
the world works, Kenneth.

446
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:38,427
Bosses steal,

447
00:16:38,495 --> 00:16:40,396
and employees use it
for leverage.

448
00:16:40,463 --> 00:16:42,765
So what do you want?
Money? A promotion?

449
00:16:42,832 --> 00:16:43,933
I can get you into a restaurant

450
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,668
where you watch a child
play with a bunny,

451
00:16:45,735 --> 00:16:46,735
then you eat the bunny.

452
00:16:46,803 --> 00:16:48,070
Isn't that just Easter?

453
00:16:48,138 --> 00:16:50,572
And I don't want anything, sir.

454
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,574
I'm just happy
to spend all day here

455
00:16:52,642 --> 00:16:53,776
helping my work family.

456
00:16:53,843 --> 00:16:56,245

I now work for a man

457
00:16:56,313 --> 00:16:57,646
who thinks like you.

458
00:16:57,714 --> 00:16:59,915
Does he also solve mazes
by starting from the end?

459
00:16:59,983 --> 00:17:02,384
I need this, Kenneth.
I used you, now leverage it.

No, sir.

463
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:10,125
I am ordering you to strike me.

464
00:17:10,193 --> 00:17:11,193
There will be no retaliation,

465
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:12,561
but if you refuse,
you're fired.

466

No.
I don't even know how.

00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:57,506
I was just about
to hop on my bus

481
00:17:57,574 --> 00:17:58,640
back to Philadelphia.

482
00:17:58,708 --> 00:17:59,908
I don't fly,
but I got my own bus

483
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:01,143
with a pool table in it.

484
00:18:01,211 --> 00:18:03,612
We'll drive to Branson
together sometime,

485
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,347
take in a Yakov Smirnoff show.

486
00:18:05,415 --> 00:18:07,416
Doesn't Russia sound
like a crazy place?

487
00:18:07,484 --> 00:18:08,717
Yes, sir.

488
00:18:08,785 --> 00:18:11,420
But before you go,
I want you to meet someone.

489
00:18:11,471 --> 00:18:14,323
This is Kenneth Parcell,
one of our pages.

490
00:18:14,391 --> 00:18:15,474
Oh, I didn't notice
you there, son.

491
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:17,259
You do not have
a lot of charisma.

492
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:19,061
Kenneth is the one
who came up with

493
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:21,530
the Blabar idea, not me.

494
00:18:21,598 --> 00:18:24,266
- I'm sorry I misled you.
- Oh.

495
00:18:24,334 --> 00:18:27,469
Well, Jack, I have to say
I'm surprised.

496
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,571
Here is my letter
of resignation.

497
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:31,440
It's probably for the best

498
00:18:31,491 --> 00:18:33,475
since this is obviously
not a good fit.

499
00:18:33,543 --> 00:18:35,477
If you call security
to escort me out,

500
00:18:35,545 --> 00:18:37,346
you should know
I have several pistols

501
00:18:37,414 --> 00:18:38,480
hidden on me.

502
00:18:38,548 --> 00:18:41,150
Hold on, Jack.
No one's quitting.

503
00:18:41,217 --> 00:18:42,885
I'm impressed you told me that.

504
00:18:42,952 --> 00:18:46,055
You have a reputation,
Jack, as a shark.

505
00:18:46,122 --> 00:18:49,158
Kabletown, we're not sharks.
We're more like...

506
00:18:49,225 --> 00:18:51,560
Whatever
the friendliest fish is.

507
00:18:51,628 --> 00:18:53,962
I'm not a science guy.
The point is,

508
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,864
I wasn't sure how 
you were gonna fit in,

509
00:18:55,932 --> 00:18:58,100
but you doing 
something like this

510
00:18:58,168 --> 00:19:00,168
tells me we're gonna 
be just fine.

511
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,522
Very well. Good.

512
00:19:03,606 --> 00:19:05,007
And Jack should
give you something

513
00:19:05,075 --> 00:19:07,576
- for that idea, son.
- Finally. Thank you.

514
00:19:07,644 --> 00:19:10,863
- Quid pro quo.
- But I don't want anything.

515
00:19:10,947 --> 00:19:12,347
No?
How about a hug?

516
00:19:14,534 --> 00:19:15,684
You've gotta be kidding me.

517
00:19:18,288 --> 00:19:20,355
- Heh...
- Sir...

518
00:19:20,407 --> 00:19:21,557
It doesn't count as a hug

519
00:19:21,624 --> 00:19:23,358
unless it goes on
for ten seconds.

520
00:19:23,426 --> 00:19:24,660
You got that right, son.

521
00:19:24,727 --> 00:19:30,032
One...Mississippi...

522
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,201
That's some good hugging.

523
00:19:32,268 --> 00:19:34,436
And as excited as I am
to be joining the team

524
00:19:34,504 --> 00:19:35,771
on Nightly News,

525
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:38,340
I will miss my dear friends
here on basic cable.

526
00:19:38,391 --> 00:19:41,210
But, Carmen, you have an
exciting new assignment, right?

527
00:19:41,277 --> 00:19:43,712
Yes. I will be
covering hurricanes...

528
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,682
Thank you, Lemon.
I owe you.

529
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:48,434
If you want to 
make it up to me,

530
00:19:48,518 --> 00:19:50,352
I have my eye
on a toilet pillow

531
00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:52,387
from a certain
medical supply store.

532
00:19:52,439 --> 00:19:53,856
Avery and I want
the baby's middle name

533
00:19:53,923 --> 00:19:56,225
to be Elizabeth, after you.

534
00:19:56,292 --> 00:19:59,361
Oh, Jack, that's so gayballs.

535
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:00,579
[Knock on door]

536
00:20:00,663 --> 00:20:03,949
Hey, Liz.
Can we get you anything?

537
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:06,568
Do you need some liniment
rubbed on your perineum?

538
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:08,937
No, guys,
I'm not really pregnant.

539
00:20:09,005 --> 00:20:10,456
I was just pretending
to help Jack.

540
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,774
Why would you pretend
to help Jack?

541
00:20:12,842 --> 00:20:13,775
Help him for real.

542
00:20:13,843 --> 00:20:15,377
It takes the same 
amount of time.

543
00:20:15,428 --> 00:20:18,780
No, Tracy, she lied to us.

544
00:20:18,848 --> 00:20:20,081
And she ordered us around

545
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:21,617
like we were
a couple of <i>normals.</i>

546
00:20:21,684 --> 00:20:24,920
You will be punished.
Can I have my nunchucks back?

547
00:20:24,988 --> 00:20:27,422
Or we could call it even.

548
00:20:29,192 --> 00:20:30,759
Good God!

549
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,862
I have been punished.
These are yours to keep.

550
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:40,802
What?
Who's the black guy?

551
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,771
A bicycle messenger.

552
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:45,274
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font> corrected dny238
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

553
00:20:45,341 --> 00:20:47,435
You took your pants off.

554
00:20:47,886 --> 00:20:50,762
What if there was a channel that's just
the sound of people having a party

555
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:52,730
 so you put it on
when you call your parents?

556
00:20:53,425 --> 00:20:55,790
You know what my TV is?

557
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:56,861
A sunset.

558
00:20:56,981 --> 00:20:59,360
How about a button you push
on your remote

559
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,861
and you can buy
anything you see on TV?

560
00:21:01,981 --> 00:21:06,185
Like if you're watching Sex and the City and
you just have to have Mr. Big's spaghetti?

561
00:21:06,305 --> 00:21:09,356
What if we executed someone live on TV?

562
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:13,037
And then I pull off my mask

563
00:21:13,157 --> 00:21:15,771
and I'm a lizard person too.

564
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:18,501
Blackout. End of episode.
